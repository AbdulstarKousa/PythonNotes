""" dropout:
    The most common method to reduce overfitting 
    (outside of early-stopping) is dropout, where we
    randomly drop input units.

    During training we want to use dropout to prevent overfitting, 
    but during inference we want to use the entire network. 
    So, we need to turn off dropout during validation, testing, 
    and whenever we're using the network to make predictions. 
    To do this, you use model.eval()
    You can turn dropout back on by setting the
    model to train mode with model.train()
